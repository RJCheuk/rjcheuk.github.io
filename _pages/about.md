I am currently Graduate student majoring in Computer Software Engineering from [School of Information and Computer Science](https://ics.uci.edu/) [University of California, Irvine](https://www.uci.edu/). My research interest includes Human-Computer interaction (HCI), Software Engineering and Health informatics.

I got my dual Bachelor of Science degree in Finance from University of Indianapolis and NingboTech University. To further my programming skills with passion of computer, I joined ICS school of UCI as a Master student. Interdisciplinary learning has given me a deeper understanding of both fields.

I am currently seeking research opportunities of HCI,  if you need a research assistant with background of computer science(especially software),  data analysis, feel free to reach out to me, it is my pleasure to cooperate with you.
